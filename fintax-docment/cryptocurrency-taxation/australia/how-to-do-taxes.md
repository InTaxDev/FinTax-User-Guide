## How to Submit Crypto Taxes

Once you have reconciled your cryptocurrency calculations, you can submit your tax return by filling out and mailing the tax form to the ATO or by using myTax, an online tax filing service associated with the ATO. Submitting online through myTax is a fast, simple, secure, and reliable way to prepare and file your tax return. This also helps you receive refunds faster.



## How to Report Crypto Taxes After Purchasing a FinTax Plan

1. **Tax Filing Methods**

* **Self-Reporting**: FinTax only helps you calculate the income portion from crypto. If you have other sources of income, you need to add these to the FinTax calculation and report the total amount. If you do not run a personal business and do not invest in cryptocurrency as a profession, you can use the paper filing method. If you have either of these conditions, you need to use the ATO-provided MyTax tax software to file your return.&#x20;

For details on the self-reporting process, refer to the ["Filing Instructions - Australia."](../../faqs/appendix/tax-filing-guide-for-australia.md)

* **Agent Reporting**: You can download your tax report and share it with your tax professional, or you can share your account with them to view and edit. Your tax professional or agent will be able to understand the FinTax tax draft and help you complete the filing. (If your reconciled annual income is zero or below $18,200, you need to submit a "Non-Lodgment Advice" form.)
