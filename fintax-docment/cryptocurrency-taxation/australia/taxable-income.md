# Taxable income

## How Cryptocurrency Tax Works in Australia

If you receive cryptocurrency through mining, forks, airdrops (even unintended ones), or as payment for goods/services, you must report this income on your tax return. See below for a breakdown of how Australian cryptocurrency tax applies to mining, donations/gifts, forks, and airdrops (or refer to our Cryptocurrency Income Tax Guide).



## Tax Scenarios for Different Transactions

Most activities involving crypto assets constitute a transaction, meaning they are subject to a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) event. However, if you are running a cryptocurrency trading business, trading stock rules apply instead of CGT rules.



## How to Determine if You are Subject to Trading Stock Rules or CGT Rules

1. **A business may hold and use crypto assets:**
   * If the business is engaged in crypto asset activities (including trading, mining, exchange businesses, or selling non-fungible tokens), the crypto assets are considered trading stock.
     * The cost of acquiring these crypto assets is a deductible expense.
     * The proceeds from selling these crypto assets are assessable as ordinary income.
   * If the business uses crypto assets to exchange goods or services in the ordinary course of business (including businesses that are not specifically crypto asset businesses), these crypto assets are also treated as trading stock.
2. **Are you carrying on a business?** Not all individuals using crypto assets are carrying on a business. To be considered as carrying on a business, you usually:
   * Conduct your activities for commercial reasons and in a commercially viable way.
   * Intend to make a profit or genuinely believe you will make a profit, even if this is unlikely in the short term.
   * Undertake activities in a planned, organized, and business-like manner, which may include keeping business records, preparing a business plan, and acquiring capital assets or inventory in line with your business plan.
   * Regularly repeat similar types of activities for your business.

However, the overall size of your transactions, a high volume of activity, or a level of sophistication does not necessarily mean you are carrying on a business using crypto assets.

## Crypto Transactions Involving CGT Events

1. **Determining Cost Basis:**
   * **Buy crypto with fiat:** If you purchase cryptocurrency for long-term investment, the acquisition of crypto generally constitutes a CGT event, and you need to determine the cost basis.
   * **Receive crypto as a gift:** Receiving crypto as a gift usually does not involve tax reporting. However, if you plan to hold the gift until it appreciates in value and then sell it, you need to establish the CGT cost basis at the time of receipt.
   * **Hard Fork / Airdrop:** If you receive income from an airdrop or your asset undergoes a hard fork, you may need to establish a CGT cost basis of $0 AUD for these assets, and recognize capital gains or losses upon subsequent sale.
2.  **Recognizing Capital Gains or Losses:** A CGT event occurs when you dispose of crypto assets in the following ways. You need to recognize capital gains or losses. If you have net capital gains for the entire tax year, you may be liable for tax. Note that if you are professionally trading crypto assets, trading stock rules may apply instead of CGT rules.

    * Sell crypto for fiat
    * Trade crypto for crypto
    * Purchase goods & services with crypto
    * Pay trading fees with crypto
    * Pay transfer fees with crypto
    * Give crypto as a gift
    * Margin Trading
    * Futures / Derivatives Trading

    **Note:** When gifting crypto, you may need to recognize capital gains or losses. However, if donating to a Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) organization/entity/fund, you may be exempt from certain capital gains taxes under specific conditions.
3.  **Recognizing as Ordinary Income:**

    * **Airdrop:** Airdrop income is typically treated as ordinary income. The initial airdrop generally has a market value of $0, so no income is recognized. However, if you hold the airdropped asset until it appreciates and then sell it, you typically need to recognize capital gains or losses.
    * **Mining:** Personal hobby mining is generally taxed as ordinary income. If you are operating a mining business, business income tax rules apply.
    * **Lending:** Income from cryptocurrency lending is typically treated as ordinary income.
    * **Staking Rewards:** Staking rewards income is typically treated as ordinary income.
