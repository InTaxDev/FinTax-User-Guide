## What to Do If You Cannot File Taxes by April 15

If you are unable to file your taxes by the April 15 deadline, you can apply for an automatic tax filing extension. Individual taxpayers, regardless of their income, can electronically apply for an automatic tax filing extension by submitting Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, through the IRS Free File system. You can also make an electronic payment using Direct Pay, debit card, credit card, or digital wallet, and indicate that the payment is for an extension. Additionally, you can mail Form 4868 before the tax filing deadline.

**Important Points to Note When Applying for a Tax Filing Extension:**

1. The application for a tax filing extension should be submitted before the tax filing deadline. However, this extension does not grant additional time to pay any taxes owed.
2. To avoid some penalties, taxpayers should estimate and pay their owed taxes by the tax filing deadline.
3. Special rules for tax filing extensions may apply to taxpayers serving in a combat zone, qualified hazardous duty area, living abroad, or residing in certain disaster areas. They may not need to submit an application for a tax filing extension; however, it is advisable to check eligibility before the tax filing deadline.

## **Payment Options for Individuals Unable to Pay Taxes in Full**

If you cannot pay your taxes in full by the tax filing deadline, you should pay as much as possible and apply for an online payment plan. You can receive an immediate response on the acceptance or rejection of the payment plan without needing to call or write to the IRS. The online payment plan options include:

1. **Short-Term Payment Plan**: This option is available if the total amount owed (including taxes, penalties, and interest) is less than $100,000. It provides up to 180 additional days to pay off the balance.
2. **Long-Term Payment Plan**: This option is available if the total amount owed (including taxes, penalties, and interest) is less than $50,000. It allows for monthly payments over a maximum period of 72 months. Payments can be set up using Direct Debit (automatic bank withdrawal), which eliminates the need to mail in payments each month, saving postage and reducing the likelihood of default. For balances between $25,000 and $50,000, Direct Debit is required.

Although any unpaid taxes after April 15 will continue to accrue interest and late payment penalties, the late payment penalty will be reduced by half during the period of the installment agreement. For more information on payment plan fees, visit the IRS's additional information on payment plans webpage.
