## How to Install?

First, you need to install and connect to snap. Then, there are three ways to experience FinTax:

1. **Register a new FinTax account**: For a better experience with FinTax, we recommend registering a FinTax account. Your wallet address will be automatically linked to the newly created FinTax account.
2. **Existing FinTax account**: If you already have a FinTax account, you only need to link your address to the existing account.
3. **Explore FinTax with a temporary account**: Your wallet address will be automatically linked to a temporary account for tracking purposes. After logging out, we will not retain your data.
