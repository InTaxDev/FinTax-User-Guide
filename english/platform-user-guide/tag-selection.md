## How to add/adjust Tags&#x20;

We default to treating your cryptocurrency transactions as capital gains tax events and calculate capital gains and losses accordingly. If any of your transactions are not capital gains tax events, such as wages, business income and expenses, please change the tags of your transactions. After successfully importing your transactions, review your transactions and follow the instructions to select different tags by clicking on “Mark Transaction”.&#x20;

If you have questions about tags, please refer to the [ How to Select Transaction Tags](../faqs/appendix/how-to-select-a-transaction-tag.md).
