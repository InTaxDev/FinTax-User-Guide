## Grace Period System

In principle, if a one-time tax payment would make it difficult for you to continue your business or livelihood, or if special circumstances would cause you to lose property, you can apply for the national tax grace period system with the tax office. This system allows for a tax payment deferral of up to one year (note). The grace period system includes the Deferral of Collection (Articles 151 and 151-2 of the National Tax Collection Act) and the Deferral of Tax Payment (Article 46 of the National Tax General Law). Depending on the type of grace period, if payment is made in installments within the grace period, the tax payment can be deferred for up to one year. If paying in installments, the payments are made according to the taxpayer's financial capacity. The requirements and impacts of the grace period are as follows:

1. It is recognized that a one-time national tax payment could make it difficult to continue business operations or maintain a livelihood.
2. It is acknowledged that the taxpayer has a sincere intention to pay the tax.
3. There is no outstanding national tax debt apart from the tax for which the grace period is sought.
4. In principle, collateral is provided.

If the above conditions are met, you can apply for a deferral within six months after the national tax payment due date to obtain a Deferral of Collection.
