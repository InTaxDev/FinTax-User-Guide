#### Penalty for Late Tax Payment

If you face penalties for late tax payment, you can apply for a S45 WHT Penalty Waiver to request a waiver of the late payment penalty. Your appeal will only be considered if the following conditions are met:

* You have paid the outstanding tax in full.
* You have not received a waiver in the past two calendar years.
* You commit to paying taxes on time in the future, including taking measures to prevent future late payments, such as registering for GIRO.

#### Extending GIRO Income Tax Payment Plan

If you are facing financial difficulties and need more time to pay your taxes, you can apply for an extended payment plan through the "Apply for Payment Plan" digital service on the myTax Portal. Please note that the installment plan is only available if you choose to pay via GIRO.

#### Consequences of Late or Non-filing of Tax Returns

Failing to file your income tax return by the due date is an offense. If you fail to file by the deadline, IRAS may take the following enforcement actions:

* Issue a Notice of Estimated Assessment. You must pay the estimated tax within one month.
* Impose a composition fee.
* Summon you to court.

**Notice of Estimated Assessment**

IRAS may issue a Notice of Estimated Assessment based on your past years' income or any other information. When estimating your tax, IRAS may assume an increase in income. If you receive a Notice of Estimated Assessment, you need to:

* Pay the estimated tax within one month from the date of the notice.
* Pay the estimated tax even if you intend to object to the assessment or are awaiting the result of your objection. Late payment will incur penalties.
* Immediately submit your income tax return: You must immediately submit your income tax return and/or certified financial statements and other documents for IRAS to review the estimated tax amount. Overpaid tax will be refunded.

**Payment of Composition Amount**

When paying the composition amount using your preferred payment method, indicate the payment slip number. GIRO payment is not allowed. Payments will be processed within three working days. You can log in to mytax.iras.gov.sg and select "View Account Summary" to check if the payment has been credited. If you still have not submitted the outstanding tax return and documents after paying the composition amount, you may still face legal proceedings. The payment will be used to settle any outstanding taxes.

**Request for Waiver of Composition Amount**

You can appeal online through the Penalty Waiver digital service (mytax.iras.gov.sg). Appeals will only be considered if:

* You have submitted the outstanding tax return and/or documents\* by the deadline specified in the settlement offer; and
* You have been filing your returns on time for the past two years. \*The return (including applicable certified financial statements) must be reflected in your tax account.

#### Court Summons

IRAS may issue a court summons if it does not receive the following by the due date:

* The required tax return and/or documents
* Payment of the composition amount

If you do not wish to attend court, you must complete the following at least one week before the summons date:

* Submit the outstanding tax return and/or documents.
* Pay the composition amount (indicating the payment slip number).

**Deferring Court Hearing**

If you need more time to submit and/or pay the composition amount, you must appear in court on the summons date to request a deferral. If you do not attend court, legal action may be taken against you, including issuing a warrant of arrest. In court, if convicted, you may face a fine of up to $5,000 per offense. You will still need to submit the outstanding income tax return and/or documents, or further legal action may be taken.

#### Non-filing of Tax Returns for Two Years or More

If you have not filed your tax return for two years or more, you may receive a court summons. Once convicted by the court, you may be required to pay:

* A penalty twice the amount of the assessed tax.
* A fine of up to $5,000.

If you fail to pay the penalty or fine to the court, you may face imprisonment for up to six months.
