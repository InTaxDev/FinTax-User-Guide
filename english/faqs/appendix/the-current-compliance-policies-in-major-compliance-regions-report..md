# the Current Compliance Policies in Major Compliance Regions report.

In the context of transnational financial regulation, compliant jurisdictions' governments are implementing stricter measures to enhance the taxation of cryptocurrencies. This trend is characterized by several key strategies:

**Strengthening Legislative Oversight:** Many countries are progressively establishing or refining tax regulations specific to cryptocurrencies. For example, the United Statesâ€™ Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act mandates cryptocurrency brokers to report detailed transaction information. Asian financial hubs like Hong Kong and Singapore have adopted various regulatory measures to improve market compliance.

**Detailed Tax Rules:** Tax authorities are clarifying tax classifications for various cryptocurrency transactions, distinguishing between capital gains and income tax. In Hong Kong, tax guidance explicitly differentiates between the capital nature and transactional nature of cryptocurrency earnings, applying different tax rates accordingly.

**Enhanced International Cooperation:** Given the cross-border nature of cryptocurrency transactions, tax authorities in multiple countries are strengthening their cooperation to combat tax evasion and money laundering. Canada, for instance, plans to adopt the International Cryptocurrency Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) to enhance information sharing and regulatory collaboration internationally.

**Adopting Technological Measures to Track Transactions:** Tax authorities are utilizing technological tools to improve the efficiency and accuracy of cryptocurrency tax administration. Australia's Tax Office employs data matching programs to analyze compliance using data provided by exchanges.

These measures collectively reflect a global trend towards stricter cryptocurrency tax policies. Regional governments and international policies are increasingly focused on ensuring compliance and transparency in cryptocurrency transactions.



## **1. North American Policies**

### **1.1 United States Policies**

**Cryptocurrency Tax Policies:**

At the federal level, the IRS issued Notice 2014-21, classifying most cryptocurrency transactions (including exchanges between cryptocurrencies, conversions to fiat currency, and purchases of goods and services) as capital gain tax events, subject to capital gains tax. Earnings from airdrops, hard forks, or receiving cryptocurrency as remuneration are subject to income tax.

At the state level, some states consider cryptocurrencies intangible property or mediums of exchange, exempting them from sales tax. However, when using cryptocurrencies to purchase taxable goods and services, sales tax applies.

**Recent Regulatory Policies:**

In September 2022, the Biden administration released the first regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. In 2022 alone, over 50 digital asset-related bills were introduced in Congress.

The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires cryptocurrency brokers to report detailed transaction information starting January 1, 2024. Additionally, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed in January 2024 that banks and money services businesses record transactions involving private cryptocurrency wallets. In April 2024, the IRS issued Form 1099-DA to further specify reporting requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges.



### **1.2 Canadian Policies**

**Cryptocurrency Tax Policies:**

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), responsible for tax administration, released a "Cryptocurrency Users and Tax Professionals Guide" in 2020. It clarifies that the CRA generally treats cryptocurrencies as commodities under Canadian tax law. Consequently, cryptocurrency transaction income may be considered business income or capital gains.

For individuals, business income from cryptocurrency transactions is fully taxable, whereas capital gains are taxed at 50%. Disposal actions include converting to fiat, exchanging for other cryptocurrencies, purchasing goods and services, and gifting. Activities such as mining and day trading are usually taxed as business income.

**Recent Regulatory Policies:**

The 2022 federal budget announced a legislative review focusing on digital currency and financial sector stability and security. The initial review phase targets digital currencies, including cryptocurrencies. In June 2023, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) issued new rules requiring exchanges and platforms to comply with "enhanced investor protection commitments." In April 2024, the federal budget announced plans to adopt CARF by 2026.

### **2.1 Australian Cryptocurrency Tax and Regulatory Policies**

**Cryptocurrency Tax Policies:**

**Personal Income Tax (PIT):** Receiving cryptocurrency as remuneration may be subject to personal income tax, with rates ranging from 0% to 45%, with adjustments effective July 1, 2024.

**Capital Gains Tax (CGT):** Individuals or entities profiting from buying and selling or disposing of cryptocurrencies (converting to fiat or purchasing goods and services) must consider CGT. CGT is a branch of income tax, with rates determined by total taxable income. Investors holding cryptocurrency for over a year may receive a 50% discount on CGT.

**Goods and Services Tax (GST):** GST-registered businesses accepting cryptocurrency payments must account for GST on their supplies and declare it in their activity statements. Some intermediaries' supplies may be GST-liable, with a rate of 10%.

**Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT):** Paying wages in cryptocurrency may involve FBT.

**Recent Regulatory Policies:**

The Australian Taxation Office views cryptocurrency as an asset for holding or trading, not currency. The primary regulator is the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). In 2022, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) set a goal to implement cryptocurrency regulations by 2025, covering the entire chain from investment to customer service. In April 2024, the ATO disclosed its data matching program, requiring exchanges to provide personal data and transaction details to promote tax compliance and prevent tax evasion.



### **2.2 New Zealand Policies**

**Cryptocurrency Tax Policies:**

**Income Tax:** Income from mining, staking, selling, or trading cryptocurrencies (if deemed business-related) is taxed at rates from 10.5% to 39%.

**Goods and Services Tax (GST):** Payments for goods and services using cryptocurrency are subject to 15% GST.

**Gift Tax:** Cryptocurrency gifts are taxed based on value, with rates from 0% to 25%.

**Recent Regulatory Policies:**

Cryptocurrencies in New Zealand are not considered legal tender but property. Regulation involves multiple agencies, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) monitoring cryptocurrency development and its impact on the financial system, and the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) overseeing trading and issuance compliance. Recent guidelines include Initial Coin Offering (ICO) guidance, classifying certain cryptocurrencies as financial products. The Inland Revenue Department provides businesses with compliance guidelines, emphasizing transparency and adherence to existing legal frameworks.



## **3. Policies in Asian Financial Centers (Hong Kong, Singapore)**

### **3.1 Hong Kong Policies**

**Cryptocurrency Tax Policies:**

Hong Kong taxes cryptocurrency based on territorial principles, taxing profits and income arising from Hong Kong. Although specific cryptocurrency tax laws are not yet established, the revised Departmental Interpretation and Practice Note No. 39 (DIPN 39) issued in March 2020 provides detailed requirements. It distinguishes between capital and transactional gains, with capital gains being tax-exempt and transactional gains subject to profits tax.

For individuals, taxes are progressive, ranging from 2% to 17%. For corporations, the first HKD 2 million of profits are taxed at 8.25%, with subsequent profits taxed at 16.5%. For sole proprietorships and partnerships, rates are 7.5% and 15%, respectively.

**Recent Regulatory Policies:**

On June 1, 2023, the "Guideline for Operators of Virtual Asset Trading Platforms" took effect, requiring compliance with SFC standards for licensing. In August 2023, the Hong Kong government allowed licensed exchanges to offer services to retail investors. In April 2024, public consultations on the OTC licensing system concluded, proposing mandatory licenses for all OTC platforms operating in Hong Kong. On April 15, 2024, the SFC approved three institutions to issue Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, marking a regulatory milestone.



### **3.2 Singapore Policies**

**Cryptocurrency Tax Policies:**

Singapore does not impose capital gains tax; hence, long-term investment gains from cryptocurrencies are tax-exempt. However, transactional gains are subject to income tax. Digital payment tokens are GST-exempt, avoiding the 8% GST on purchases of goods and services using certain cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether).

Income received in cryptocurrency form is taxable, with personal tax rates from 0% to 24% and corporate tax at a flat 17%.

**Recent Regulatory Policies:**

On August 15, 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) unveiled a regulatory framework to enhance the stability of single-currency stablecoins. In April 2024, the "Payment Services (Amendment) Bill" was passed, broadening the regulatory scope of cryptocurrency services. The bill mandates licenses for digital payment token service providers and imposes requirements such as asset segregation, maintaining proper books and records, and ensuring asset integrity and security. The directive is expected to take effect on October 4, 2024.
