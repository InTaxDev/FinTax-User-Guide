# Cryptocurrency Policy

## What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptographic technology to ensure transaction security and control the creation of new units. Cryptocurrencies are usually based on decentralized consensus mechanisms, meaning that no single entity or government controls them. Bitcoin is one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies, created by the mysterious figure Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. The transaction records of cryptocurrencies are typically stored on a blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that provides transparency and immutability.



## How Do Tax Authorities Know About My Cryptocurrency?

Tax authorities such as the Australian Taxation Office, the U.S. IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, and HM Revenue & Customs use a variety of technologies to track cryptocurrency transactions and enforce tax compliance.

* EXCHANGE REPORTING: Most cryptocurrency exchanges are required to report users' transaction records to tax authorities. For example, the Australian government once required crypto exchanges to report personal data for up to 1.2 million accounts.

* Bank and Payment Service Provider Reporting: If you exchange cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies with each other, banks and payment service providers may also report large or suspicious transactions.&#x20;
* Specialized analytical tools: Tax authorities use analytical tools to track and identify cryptocurrency transactions.



## Are Cryptocurrencies Taxed?

**Yes.** In most jurisdictions around the world, including Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and India, tax authorities impose taxes on cryptocurrency transactions. For example, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) treats cryptocurrencies as assets rather than currency. This means that individuals or businesses have tax obligations when buying, selling, or otherwise dealing with cryptocurrencies. This includes transactions, exchanges, sales, donations, or converting cryptocurrencies to fiat currency. The tax amount depends on the capital gains/losses amount, the duration you hold the asset, and specific regulations in your country/region/jurisdiction. Since each taxable event may generate capital gains, you need to keep track of the dates, cost basis, sales value, and any fees associated with each transaction.&#x20;

## Taxable and Non-Taxable Events in Cryptocurrency

### **Taxable Events**

* **Selling Cryptocurrency:** When selling cryptocurrency for fiat currency, you may need to pay capital gains tax based on the difference between the purchase and sale prices of the cryptocurrency.
* **Trading Cryptocurrency:** Exchanging one cryptocurrency for another can result in capital gains or losses that need to be taxed based on the value change at the time of the transaction.
* **Using Cryptocurrency to Purchase Goods or Services:** Using cryptocurrency for payments may incur income tax based on the fair market value of the cryptocurrency at the time of payment and the cost of the goods or services.
* **Receiving Cryptocurrency as Income:** If you receive cryptocurrency as compensation for goods or services, you need to report it as taxable income based on its market value when received.
* **Mining and Staking Cryptocurrency:** Rewards obtained from mining or staking cryptocurrency need to be reported as taxable income based on the market price when received.
* **Airdrops and Hard Forks:** Receiving tokens from airdrops or new currencies from hard forks may generate taxable income that needs to be reported accordingly.

### **Non-Taxable Events**

*   #### Personal Use Asset

    If you hold or use a crypto asset (such as Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency) mainly for personal use, for example, to buy items for personal use or consumption, the crypto asset is considered a personal use asset. In this case, the asset does not involve a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) event.

    For more details, refer to: [Crypto asset as a personal use asset](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/crypto-asset-investments/crypto-asset-as-a-personal-use-asset)
*   **Transferring Crypto Between Your Own Wallets**

    Transferring crypto between your own different wallets does not involve a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) event.
*   **Lost or Stolen Crypto**

    Lost or stolen crypto does not involve a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) event.



## Cost Basis Accounting Methods

* **FIFO(first in first out)：**when the cost basis of the share acquiredfirst is used（let's say you buy 10 shares of XYZ stock on January 5, 2017 for $1,000 ($100 per share). On June 10 of the same year, XYZ was trading at $120 per share, and you decide to buy another 10 shares at $1,200. If you decide to sell five shares today, with the FIFO method, your cost base will be $500, or the price you pay for the first share of XYZ stock you purchase.）
* **LlFO (last in, first out)：**when the cost basis of the share acquired lastis used（let's say you buy 10 shares of XYZ stock on January 5, 2017 for $1,000 ($100 per share). On June 10 of the same year, XYZ was trading at $120 per share, and you decide to buy another 10 shares at $1,200. If you decide to sell five shares today, with the FIFO method, your cost base will be $600, or the price you pay for the first share of XYZ stock you purchase.）
* **Average cost basis**：or taking the average cost paid for allinvestments and using it for all shares sold. This is only used formutual funds（If you buy 10 shares of XYZ at $100 per share and then 10 shares at $120 each, your cost basis will be the total cost ($2,200) divided by the total number of shares (20 shares), which is $110 per share.）

## Difference between the two returns in Australia

&#x20;The Australian Individual Tax Return and its Schedule are similar in that they both report your income and deductions; the Individual Tax Return covers wages, allowances, dividends, etc., while the Schedule focuses on capital gains, income from a business (which is listed on the Schedule, but you will need to report it via the MyTax app), foreign source income, and other income. Think of it this way: almost everyone is required to file an Individual Tax Return, but not everyone has the income listed on the schedules, so some people may not need the schedules. If you buy and sell cryptocurrencies, in most cases you will need to file a Schedule because your cryptocurrency income may be part of a capital gain.
