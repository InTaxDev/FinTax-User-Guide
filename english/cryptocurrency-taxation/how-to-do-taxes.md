## How to Apply for a Tax Filing Extension&#x20;

* Australia

In Australia, if you choose to file through a tax agent or agency, you must inform your tax agent by October 31 so they can help you register, allowing your filing deadline to be extended to May 15 of the following year. In other cases, if you need to apply for a tax extension, please contact your tax agent or agency.

* Hong Kong

In Hong Kong, authorized representatives can apply for a batch extension to file their clients' tax returns for the current year. To participate in this arrangement, representatives need to apply in writing to the Inland Revenue Department and include a copy of their Business Registration Certificate, a copy of the practicing certificate or registration certificate issued by their professional accountancy body (if applicable), and a client list with at least ten clients' names and their Inland Revenue Department file numbers. The application materials should be submitted to the General Section, 1/F, Revenue Tower, 5 Hoi Shing Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, ensuring that the mail is sufficiently stamped. Once the application is approved, the Inland Revenue Department will provide a file number for future reference. Additionally, successfully registered tax representatives can opt to submit the extension application electronically via the internet using the facilities provided on the "GovHK" website. Users must first complete and submit a registration form to obtain a user password. After registration, the Inland Revenue Department will provide operational instructions and a password, allowing representatives to use the electronic submission service by entering their Business Registration Number and password.&#x20;

* Singapore

In Singapore, if you are facing delays in tax payments, you may incur fines. However, you can apply for a S45 WHT Penalty Waiver to attempt to waive these fines. Conditions for the waiver include having paid the overdue tax in full, not having received a waiver in the past two calendar years, and committing to paying taxes on time in the future, which may include registering for GIRO to ensure timely payments. If you are experiencing financial hardship and need more time to pay your taxes, you can apply for an extended payment plan through the "Apply for Payment Plan" digital service on the myTax Portal. Note that the installment plan is only available if you choose to pay through GIRO. For the current tax year, you can submit unpaid income tax returns electronically via mytax.iras.gov.sg. If you cannot access the tax returns online, you can contact IRAS to obtain paper forms. For previous years' assessments, you can also contact IRAS for paper forms. If IRAS does not receive the required tax returns and/or documents and the overdue penalty amount, they may issue a court summons. If you wish to avoid court, you must submit the outstanding tax returns and/or documents and pay the penalty amount at least one week before the summons date.

* Japan

In Japan, taxpayers facing difficulty in paying taxes by the due date can apply for the National Tax Payment Deferral System. If paying the tax in one lump sum would cause financial hardship or asset loss, and the taxpayer has a genuine intention to pay the taxes, they can apply for a deferral period of up to one year, including deferral conversion and tax payment deferral. Applications for deferral must be submitted to the local tax office before the due date and usually require collateral unless specific conditions are met, such as amounts less than 1 million yen, deferral periods less than three months, or inability to provide collateral. Additionally, if significant losses occur due to disasters or other personal circumstances, deferred tax payments can be applied without collateral. Once granted, the tax office will suspend seizures and property conversions, and overdue taxes may be reduced or waived. Applications can be made through electronic tax filing software, and the tax office will send a deferral notice to the taxpayer upon successful application.&#x20;

* United States

If individuals cannot file their tax returns by the April 15 deadline, they can apply for a tax extension in several ways. Regardless of income, they can electronically submit Form 4868 through the IRS Free File system to automatically request an extension. Additionally, they can make payments electronically and mail Form 4868 before the tax deadline. It is important to note that a filing extension does not extend the time to pay taxes, so estimated taxes should be paid when applying for an extension to avoid penalties. Special rules may apply for taxpayers serving in combat zones, living abroad, or in certain disaster areas, who may not need to apply for a filing extension. If taxpayers cannot pay their taxes in full by the deadline, they can apply for an online payment plan, which includes a short-term payment plan for amounts owed less than $100,000, providing up to 180 additional days to pay the balance, and a long-term payment plan for amounts owed less than $50,000, allowing monthly payments for up to 72 months. For balances between $25,000 and $50,000, direct debit must be used to set up payments, saving postage and reducing the risk of default. While unpaid taxes accrue interest and late payment penalties after April 15, the late payment penalty will be halved during the installment agreement period.&#x20;

* Canada

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows taxpayers to apply for a tax payment deferral under specific circumstances, typically for those facing financial hardship or other special situations. Payment deferral applications usually need to be submitted to CRA before the tax due date. Applications can be made through CRA's "My Account" online service, by phone, mail, or in writing, depending on your specific situation and CRA's requirements. When applying for a payment deferral, you will need to provide financial statements, bank statements, proof of income and expenses, and other documents to support your application. CRA will evaluate your application and decide whether to approve the payment deferral, providing a new payment due date if approved. For more details, please refer to [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/remitting-source-deductions/how-when-remit-due-dates.html#h\_2](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/remitting-source-deductions/how-when-remit-due-dates.html#h\_2)

* South Korea

In South Korea, the tax filing period for companies is from March 1 to May 31 each year. If a business needs to extend its tax filing, it must apply to the National Tax Service before May 31. For individual income tax, missing the filing deadline will result in a "no declaration additional tax," and if the tax payment is late, a "delayed payment additional tax" will be levied, which includes late payment interest. This means that extending the tax payment may incur additional financial burdens. For more details, please refer to [https://www.nts.go.kr/english/main.do](https://www.nts.go.kr/english/main.do).



## How to Submit Crypto Taxes

Once you have reconciled your cryptocurrency calculations, you can submit your tax return by filling out and mailing the tax form to the ATO or by using myTax, an online tax filing service associated with the ATO. Submitting online through myTax is a fast, simple, secure, and reliable way to prepare and file your tax return. This also helps you receive refunds faster.



## How to Report Crypto Taxes After Purchasing a FinTax Plan

1. **Tax Filing Methods**

* **Self-Reporting**: FinTax only helps you calculate the income portion from crypto. If you have other sources of income, you need to add these to the FinTax calculation and report the total amount. If you do not run a personal business and do not invest in cryptocurrency as a profession, you can use the paper filing method. If you have either of these conditions, you need to use the ATO-provided MyTax tax software to file your return.&#x20;

For details on the self-reporting process, refer to the ["Filing Instructions - Australia."](../faqs/appendix/tax-filing-guide-for-australia.md)

* **Agent Reporting**: You can download your tax report and share it with your tax professional, or you can share your account with them to view and edit. Your tax professional or agent will be able to understand the FinTax tax draft and help you complete the filing. (If your reconciled annual income is zero or below $18,200, you need to submit a "Non-Lodgment Advice" form.)
